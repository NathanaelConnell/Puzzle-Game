Summary:
A 3D puzzle game where you start on lower floors of a labyrinth type of structure and solve puzzles to ascend the rooms.
The puzzles will be building and physically themed with physics and other mechanics to make the puzzles challenging.  
There will be an overarching story that will be revealed as you climb the vertical labyrinth.  
There will be a strong push to make the game multiplier but not officially included.  
It will be a full game experience with animations and scenes to make the game feel official.

What to care about:
You and others should care and want to use this program primarily to have fun and enjoy original content.  
We intend to fill gaps in the niche of 3d physics puzzling games while also providing a unique story that can be enjoyed.  
There will also be mechanics and ideas that we as group personally haven't experienced.  

Components and resources:
We plan on using Blender for our modeling and some animations as well.  
We will start with Unreal game engine but if it doesn't fit our needs or is too strenuous on learning then we will use unity.  
For voice over we will most likely use audacity or if the game engines support it well enough we will just use those.  

Rough Plan:
We will most likely start by creating assets and creating animations and effects.  
Complete one room and make sure everything fits in correctly and then gradually add new rooms/levels and new mechanics over the majority of the time.  
Sound and Voice acting will probably be on the back end and making additional content like multiplayer will probably happen after a good chunk of the 
levels and mechanics are already made and working.
